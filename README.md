# My NixOS and Home-Manager config

This repository contains my whole NixOS and Home-Manager configuration.

Feel free to use whatever you need but be aware that I'm still in the process of learning and things might not be implemented in an ideal way.


## Credits
The whole structure of this repository is based on [Misterio77](https://github.com/Misterio77)'s [nix-config](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-config).
Those resources helped me so much to get started. Thanks a lot!

Check out his [Starter config](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-configs) for a cool starting point if you're interesetd in [Nix](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix_package_manager).
